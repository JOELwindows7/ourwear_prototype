# Simply Nothing
I made a minigame that is nothing.

it's just a switch. ON/OFF switch. that's it.

# What is this?
It's a fidget toy. turn on the switch on to make it bright, and switch off to make it dark.

When it's on, the color goes the brightest one. When it's off, the color goes the darkest one, with unlit app bar.

# I can't install Unity
There is https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_unity_widget which embeds Unity application as a flutter widget.

but unfortunately, I cannot install Unity because my disk full! even my external disks I currently have also full.

so I uninstalled some softwares which save data are cloud. now that should work.

# AR
idk. maybe later.
