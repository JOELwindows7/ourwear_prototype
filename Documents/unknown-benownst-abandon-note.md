Ahei Wearers. Quick webcam update here.

I'm sorry, somehow the record system broke this time. Computer cannot record voice. here's clap.

Okay.

These games (I mean this game) coding will be transfered to a brand new software we are making.

as you can see, I am now focusing on minigame part while Anthony will be on the main software part.

I have added highscore button on top right so you can see highscore of your khochoc number.

So basically it.

Why didn't I want to use Nox (Android emulator that emulate smartphone fully)? because I cannot further overload my SSD. help! I need 4 TB hard disk or better, buy me PC parts for me to build! and also I am afraid that it may lag here.

also The latest Firebase pubspec deprecates majority of the synthax, so I have to see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa0rdbb53I8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9j--TKIdkb3ISfRbJeJYQwC&index=2 YouTube tutorial (I have been inspired from) again and find comment of pubspec yaml with version of time before abandoning those syntax.  
Which is why it did error after long time not been compiled. Thankfully we got it fix after downgrading the pubspec up to those version mentioned in the comment.

It's quite predicament for the game engine embedding only exist for Unity, which I have to tell you as of today. Try search `Godot flutter` and that didn't there. only found `Unity flutter` thingy. despite being taught in Unity previous semester, I already hate unity, because `Made in Unity`, Revenue limit if not PRO, etc. I can't even let anyone embed minigame that made with Unity, because this is technically making revenue and if Ourwear made more than its limit of revenue, then Unity must *rob* our revenue (upgrade to PLUS or best, PRO) or else we'll be in trouble.  
That's why my progress minigame slowed down.  
I have no experience for typing just to build UI. I only have experience of drag and drop UI design & typing for functionality. i.e. I have been used to build software using a software framework which in this case Unity or better, Godot.

# That's all about it.
Thank you for your attention.

Great luck, God Bless you. Stay Safe, Be Creative.
